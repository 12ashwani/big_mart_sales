# big_mart_sales
This project aims to predict sales for BigMart outlets using historical sales data from 2013. The dataset includes 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. By building a predictive model, we can identify key factors affecting sales and help BigMart optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.
